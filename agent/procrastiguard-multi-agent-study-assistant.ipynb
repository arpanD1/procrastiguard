I can definitely help you create a study plan to get ready for your exams. Let's get this organized so you feel prepared and confident!\n\nHere's a realistic study plan based on the information you've provided:\n\n**Exam Date:** 2025-12-15\n**Daily Study Time:** 4 hours\n**Subjects & Difficulty:**\n*   Math (difficulty 5)\n*   Physics (difficulty 4)\n*   Chemistry (difficulty 3)\n\nTo make sure we give more attention to the tougher subjects, here's a possible breakdown:\n\n*   **Math:** 2 hours per day\n*   **Physics:** 1.5 hours per day\n*   **Chemistry:** 0.5 hours per day\n\nThis way, Math gets the most focus, followed by Physics, and then Chemistry. We'll aim to distribute this evenly across your study days.\n\n***\n\n### Your Study Plan\n\nSince your exam is on **2025-12-15**, we have a good amount of time to prepare! Let's assume you're starting today.\n\nHere’s a day-by-day plan for a typical week. You can repeat this structure as you get closer to your exam date.\n\n**Monday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Tuesday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Wednesday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Thursday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Friday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Saturday:**\n*   Math: 2 hours\n*   Physics: 1.5 hours\n*   Chemistry: 0.5 hours\n*   **Total: 4 hours**\n\n**Sunday:**\n*   **Rest/Review:** Take a break today! Or, if you feel you need it, use this day for light review of topics you found challenging during the week. It's important to avoid burnout.\n\n***\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n1.  **Be Flexible:** This is a template! If you find yourself struggling with a particular topic, don't be afraid to adjust the time slightly. Maybe spend an extra 30 minutes on a tough math concept on a given day.\n2.  **Active Recall:** Don't just re-read notes. Try to recall information from memory, solve practice problems, and explain concepts to yourself (or someone else!).\n3.  **Practice Tests:** As you get closer to the exam, incorporate practice tests under timed conditions. This will help you get used to the exam format and manage your time during the actual test.\n4.  **Breaks are Key:** Remember to take short breaks during your study sessions (e.g., 5-10 minutes every hour). This helps maintain focus and prevents fatigue.\n5.  **Stay Healthy:** Get enough sleep, eat well, and get some physical activity. A healthy body supports a healthy mind!\n\nYou've got this! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to this plan, or if you have other subjects you'd like to add.

I'd be absolutely delighted to help you get ready for your exams. It sounds like you've got a solid plan for your study time. Let's get this organized for you!\n\nBased on your exam date of December 15th, 2025, and your daily study commitment of 4 hours, here's a possible study plan focusing on your subjects, with more time allocated to Math and Physics due to their higher difficulty:\n\n### Your Study Plan\n\n**Key:**\n*   **Math:** Difficulty 5\n*   **Physics:** Difficulty 4\n*   **Chemistry:** Difficulty 3\n\nWe'll aim for a balanced approach, ensuring you cover all subjects without feeling overwhelmed on any single day. This plan assumes you're starting your studies soon.\n\n---\n\n**How to use this plan:**\n\n*   Each day, aim to complete the allocated study time and focus on the subjects listed.\n*   Feel free to adjust the order of subjects within a day if that works better for your learning style.\n*   Remember to take short breaks during your study sessions!\n\n---\n\nThis is a starting point, and we can always adjust it as you go. How does this look to you? Do you have any specific topics within these subjects you'd like to prioritize, or any other subjects you'd like to add? Let me know! We'll conquer these exams together!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"async def run_single_session_with_analysis(session_description: str):\n\n    print(\"====== STEP 1: Study Session Agent ======\\n\")\n\n    session_record = {}\n\n    #
